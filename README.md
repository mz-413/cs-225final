# jk36-pmcnutt2-nchint4-mmart330
Final Project

Note: Please run make in the project folder for any of the following to work.

To read a brand new .txt file of data:
1) Import file into the "project" folder
2) Open Makefile, uncomment lines 11-13 as instructed in Makefile
3) Run make in terminal, then run ./read
    Rather than running the entire program, this will only read a brand new file to avoid lengthy runtimes or errors
4) Once ./read completes and the file undirected_list has been successfully updated, comment lines 11-13 again using #.
Notes:
    Make sure the file is formatted correctly (similar to the given roadNet-PA.txt) to avoid issues;
    Please rename the brand new file as "roadNet-PA.txt";
    The output is located in undirected_list.txt;

To Run Test Cases:
1) run  make test  in terminal
2) run ./test in terminal
    To test any specific cases, run ./test [part=____]
        eg part=graph, part=bfs ...
